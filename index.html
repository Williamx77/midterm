        <h2>How A 20 Year Old Game Managed To Stay Relevant</h2>
    <!--Text Section-->

        <p> Super Smash Brothers. A household name at this point. But what isn't so well known is its underground competitive scene.
             This party game has been taken to the edges of its mechanics and back, to try to become the “best”.
              This 20-year-old game has seen more popularity than its newer counterparts. How has this game managed to beat the odds 
              and stay relevant over the years? To me — a long time player — the answer is obvious. The mechanics of the game. 
              The freedom. Unlike any other game in the world. None give you as much freedom of expression as this one. 
              The mechanics of the system work like a fine-tuned engine, just waiting for an experienced veteran to master 
              every nook and crany. Some in the community have dubbed these options as “glitches” but to me and many others,
               that's nonsense. These movement options were always intentional, and even if they weren't, they are what bring
                this game to unparraled levels of mastery. People, including myself, have dedicated years of our lives trying
                 to master certain "tech" only to realize were nowhere near the echelon of top contenders. But despite that
                  seemingly tragic circumstance, we continue playing. Not because we think we'll be able to go pro.
                   But because have tasting this magical fruit we call a game, there's no going back. Everything
                    else feels stiff and dull. What started out as a party game to play with your family,
                     turned into a competitive ocean that turns everything its waves touches into believers.
                      It's given people communities, second chances, hope, drive, desire. 
                      Some aren't sure where they would be without it. All this for a 20-year-old party game.
                       But because it's a party game a casual one, were able to see the true beauty of what makes it great.
                        Sometimes the most unlikely people turn out to be legends among the men. And this game,
                         just turned out to be great among a sea full of milked cash grabs.
                          I've tried throughout my life to find games just like this one to no avail. 
                          I'm sure many have came across the same problems. It will always remain our 
                          favorite game of all time, and while it might remain somewhat in the shadows,
                           as long as we keep on playing it, grinding pointless techniques for hours on end,
                            the game will leave on forever.

        <p2> I used to be top 10 in ontario in "ssbm". I used to think i could become the best, and still in my heart I believe it still.
            I really think everyone should give this game a try. To me, its the greatest game of all time, and nothing can match its complexity.
            I know what you must be thinking. "I played this game years ago! It was good but not worth preaching or dedicating whole lives to!"
            and to an outsider looking in your right. But as the years go on, and you see that gradual progress, and you meet people who are just as passionate
            it becomes more then a game to you. I Believe this game has so much more time left.
            Heres to another 20 more years.
